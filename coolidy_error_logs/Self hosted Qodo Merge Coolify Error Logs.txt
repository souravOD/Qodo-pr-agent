'__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.\n- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only be used for reference.\n- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+').\n- When quoting variables, names or file paths from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').\n- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete. Instead, acknowledge the visible scope boundary and analyze only the code shown.\n\n\nThe output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRReview, according to the following Pydantic definitions:\n=====\n\nclass KeyIssuesComponentLink(BaseModel):\n    relevant_file: str = Field(description=\"The full file path of the relevant file\")\n    issue_header: str = Field(description=\"One or two word title for the issue.

'__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.\n- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only be used for reference.\n- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+').\n- When quoting variables, names or file paths from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').\n- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete.

'__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.\n- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only be used for reference.\n- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+').\n- When quoting variables, names or file paths from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').\n- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete. Instead, acknowledge the visible scope boundary and analyze only the code shown.\n\n\nThe output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRReview, according to the following Pydantic definitions:\n=====\n\nclass KeyIssuesComponentLink(BaseModel):\n    relevant_file: str = Field(description=\"The full file path of the relevant file\")\n    issue_header: str = Field(description=\"One or two word title for the issue.

'__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.\n- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only be used for reference.\n- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+').\n- When quoting variables, names or file paths from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').\n- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete.

'__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.\n- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only be used for reference.\n- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+').\n- When quoting variables, names or file paths from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').\n- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete. Instead, acknowledge the visible scope boundary and analyze only the code shown.\n\n\nThe output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRReview, according to the following Pydantic definitions:\n=====\n\nclass KeyIssuesComponentLink(BaseModel):\n    relevant_file: str = Field(description=\"The full file path of the relevant file\")\n    issue_header: str = Field(description=\"One or two word title for the issue.

'__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code. If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted.\n- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only be used for reference.\n- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+').\n- When quoting variables, names or file paths from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').\n- Note that you only see changed code segments (diff hunks in a PR), not the entire codebase. Avoid suggestions that might duplicate existing functionality or questioning code elements (like variables declarations or import statements) that may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- Also note that if the code ends at an opening brace or statement that begins a new scope (like 'if', 'for', 'try'), don't treat it as incomplete. Instead, acknowledge the visible scope boundary and analyze only the code shown.\n\n\nThe output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRReview, according to the following Pydantic definitions:\n=====\n\nclass KeyIssuesComponentLink(BaseModel):\n    relevant_file: str = Field(description=\"The full file path of the relevant file\")\n    issue_header: str = Field(description=\"One or two word title for the issue.
